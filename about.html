    <h2> Hello! </h2>
    <p>Welcome to Glitchy's personal little fanfic website, where she stores the fanfic that aren't complete jokes! Here, you will find a collection of my fanfics from multiple fandoms. I might even put some oneshots on here too.</p>
    
    <br>
    
    <h2> "Who are you?" </h2>
    <p>I'm Glitchy. I could also be refered too as Davey or Error. I am a black, queer, multifandom artist, however I do dabble in a bit of writing.</p>
    <p>I am agender, bisexual, and use she/them pronouns.</p>
    <p>I think that's all that needs to be known about me. I'll update this part when I feel like adding something else.</p>
    
    <br>

    <h2> "Why this?" </h2>
    <p>To put it simply,<b> I wanted to make my own website where I could archive and share my own works.</b></p>
    <p>Every fanfic site that I use, once used, or heard of, has <i>something</i> about it that makes me wish to not use it, so I decided "Heh, why not just make my own?" So that's what I did!</p>
    <p><small>I still cross-post to Wattpad and Tumblr. Also looking for sites for other places to cross-post on.</small></p>

    <br>

    <h2> "Can i use your works for AI?" </h2>
    <p><strong>Absolutely not.</strong></p>
    <p>I do not consent for my works being used for AI Generation. I do not consent to <strong>ANY</strong> of my creations, original and fanmade, being used for AI Generation. Do not play with me.</p>

    <h2> That's all for now. Thank you! </h2>
    <p><small>Will be updated occasionally.</small></p>
